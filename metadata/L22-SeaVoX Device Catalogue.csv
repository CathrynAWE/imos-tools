OMI is designed to monitor recovery of the ozone layer by measuring different aerosols (smoke, dust, sulfates) and other criteria pollutants such as O3 (ozone), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), BrO (bromine) and chlorine dioxide (OCLO). The OMI observes Earth's solar backscattered radiation in the visible and ultraviolet spectrums with a wide-field telescope, using hyperspectral imaging in a push-broom mode. This feeds two imaging grating spectrometers, each of which employs a charged coupled device (CCD) detector. Onboard calibration includes a white light source, LEDs, and a multi-surface solar-calibration diffuser. A depolariser removes the polarisation from the backscattered radiation. The OMI has a 13 x 24 km spatial resolution which can be zoomed to 13 x 13 km for detecting and tracking urban-scale pollution sources. The OMI employs three spectral bands, with wavelengths detected in the visible spectrum from 350 - 500 nm (band 1) and wavelengths detected in the ultraviolet spectrum from 270 - 314 nm (band 2) and  306 - 380 nm (band 3).

It measures vertical profiles of spectrally dispersed, limb-scattered sunlight from the upper troposphere into the lower mesosphere to produce height profiles of O3 (ozone), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and stratospheric aerosols. It operates in the visible, near-infrared and near-ultraviolet spectrums.  The OSIRIS instrument is essentially two optical subsystems, suggested by its name: an optical spectrograph (OS) module and an infrared imager (IRI) module. The OS is a grating spectrometer with a CCD (charged coupled device) detector. Vertical profiles of the limb radiance are obtained by taking OS exposures while performing a repetitive vertical scan of the single line-of-sight through selected tangent altitude ranges (10 - 100 km). The IRI is composed of three vertical near infrared co-aligned linear array imagers that capture one-dimensional images of the limb radiance with a tangent altitude resolution of approximately 1 km. The imagers have parallel bore-sights; each one consists of an identical baffling system, lens, narrow-band interference filter, and a one-dimensional linear array of 128 thermo-electrically cooled photodetectors placed in the focal plane of the lens. Approximately 30 photodetector elements at one end of each array are covered with a mask in order to provide a continuous measure of the dark signal in the array. Therefore there are approximately 100 lines of sight from each imager channel that measure simultaneously over 100 vertical kilometres in tangent altitude. OSIRIS (OS) has a spectral range of 280 - 800 nm and a spectral resolution of 1 nm when at an altitude range of 5 -100 km. Each scan takes 40 - 70 seconds. The OS also has a minimum sensitivty of 12 kR per Angstrom per pixel. The IRI captures images of the limb radiance at at 1260, 1270, and 1530 nm and has a sensitivity of 50 kR per band per pixel.

The spectrometer uses a grating to disperse the detected radiation into its spectrum, which holds information on the atmospheric concentration of different gases. The instrument also carries two fast photometers to detect the scintillation of the input signal, which carries information on turbulence.

It is a four-band interferometer designed to measure infrared light reflected and emitted from the earth's surface and atmosphere. Column abundances of carbon dioxide and methane are calculated from the observational data.  Incoming light is split into two beams which propagate in separate optical paths to create an optical path difference. The beams then recombine to cause interference. FTS measures the intensity of interference by continuously changing the optical path length difference. A spectrum is obtained by performing a Fourier transform on the measured data. Light reflected from the earth's surface is observed in the spectral bands 1 through 3 of FTS during daytime, and the light emitted from the atmosphere is captured in band 4 during both day and night time. Prior to reaching the detectors of the instrument, the light in the bands 1 through 3 is split into two orthogonally-polarised components (P and S components) and measured independently. The light in the band 4, however, is not split. The instrument thereby observes the incoming light in seven different channels. The TANSO-FTS instrument operates within four spectral bands in the following wavelength ranges: 0.758-0.775 micrometres (band 1); 1.56-1.72 (band 2); 1.92-2.08 (band 3); 5.56-14.3 (band 4).

The instrument consists of a nadir and limb scanning component. Measurements are performed by observing the atmosphere under different viewing angles. In Nadir Mode, global distribution (total column values) of the atmospheric trace gases, clouds and aerosols are observed. In this mode, the instrument is scanning across-track. To obtain the altitude distribution of trace gases, SCIAMACHY performs observations in limb over an altitude range of 100 km, with a vertical resolution of 3 km. Light from the atmosphere is fed by the scanner unit consisting of an azimuth and an elevation scanner into the telescope which directs it onto the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The spectrometer contains a pre-disperser which separates the light into three spectral bands followed by a series of dichroic mirrors which further divide the light into a total of eight channels. A grating is located in each channel to diffract the light into a high resolution spectrum which is then focused onto eight detectors. The pre-disperser also serves as a Brewster window to separate polarised light, a part of which is sensed by the Polarisation Measurement Device (PMD). The output of the PMD is later used to correct for the polarisation effects.

The MWRI gathers light through a ground-pointing telescope, whose scan mirror oscillates (1 cycle every 33 milliseconds) over an angular displacement of plus-or-minus 2.89 degrees that is perpendicular to the orbital track. Light reflected from the surface and atmosphere as gathered by this scan passes through an optical lens train, during which the beam is divided to pass through 4 bandpass filters that produce images in 4 spectral bands. The light from each filter then reaches a set of six electronic detectors (24 in total, 6 per spectral band) that subdivides the across-track scan into 6 parallel lines, each equivalent to a ground width of 79 m.  The MWRI features 10 channels with five frequencies in the range 10.65-89 GHz. The nadir spatial resolution range varies from 15-85 km depending on frequency. The wavelengths of the four spectral bands are 0.5-0.6 micrometres, 0.6-0.7 micrometres, 0.7-0.8 micrometres and 0.8-1.1 micrometres.

PALSAR transmits successive pulses of radio waves to illuminate the target scene, and the echo of each pulse is received and recorded via an array of side-viewing beam-forming antennae. All elements of these arrays receive echos simultaneously in real time so the signals passing through them are individually subjected to controlled shifts of the phases of those signals. Signal processing of the successive recorded radar echoes allows the combining of the recordings from these multiple antenna positions to produce a high-resolution image. PALSAR has a centre frequency of 1270 MHz (L-band). In fine resolution mode, the swath width ranges from 40-70 km and a resolution of 7 - 44 m.

In addition to Altitude, the ISA500 provides Heading, Pitch and Roll as well as Temperature. Heading, Pitch and Roll readings are provided a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) sensor located within the unit. Temperature is measured by a sensor, which sits against the ISA500 end cap. The ISA500 falls into a category of a sonar, as it relies on underwater acoustics in ranging purposes. It operates by transmitting an acoustic pulse into the water, which travels until it comes into contact with the seabed. Upon contact with the seabed, part of the pulse is absorbed, and part is reflected back to the transmitter, which records the time between transmitted and reflected signal. Knowing the speed of sound in water and the time between transmitted and received (reflected) signal, once can calculate the distance.

http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL1038/,SDN:L22::TOOL1038,Operational Land Image,"The Operational Land Imager (OLI) is a high resolution optical imager designed for land and vegetation observation. It measures in the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared spectrums over nine spectral bands.  The OLI uses long detector arrays (of over 7000 detectors per spectral band) aligned across its focal plane to view across the swath. A four-mirror anastigmatic telescope focuses incident radiation onto the focal plane while providing a 15 degree field of view (FOV). Periodic sampling of the cross-track detectors as the observatory progresses along a ground track forms the multispectral digital images. The detectors are divided into 14 modules arranged in an alternating pattern along the centreline of the focal plane. The spectral differentiation is achieved by interference filters arranged in a butcher-block pattern over the detector arrays in each module. Silicon PIN (SiPIN) detectors collect the data for the visible and near-infrared spectral bands (bands 1 to 4 and 8) while Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (MgCdTe) detectors are used for the shortwave infrared bands (bands 6, 7, and 9). The OLI has a swath width of 185 km and produces images with a 30 m multi-spectral spatial resolution. The wavelengths of the nine spectral bands are 0.433-0.453 micrometres, 0.450-0.515 micrometres, 0.525-0.600 micrometres, 0.630-0.680 micrometres, 0.845-0.885 micrometres, 1.560-1.660 micrometres,  2.100-2.300 micrometres,  0.500-0.680 micrometres and 1.360-1.390 micrometres. The OLI produced data calibrated to an uncertainty of less than 5 percent in terms of absolute, at-aperture spectral radiance and to an uncertainty of less than 3 percent in terms of top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance for each of the spectral bands.

Earth-reflected sunlight is detected by an oscillating cross-track scan mirror, which scans six lines simultaneously in four spectral bands per mirror sweep. Two of these bands are in the visible spectrum, with the remaining two in the near-infrared spectrum. The four spectral bands have a spatial resolution of 79m. Their wavelengths are 0.5-0.6 micrometres, 0.6-0.7 micrometeres, 0.7-0.8 micrometres, and 0.8-1.1 micrometres. MSS has a swath width of 185 km and an 80 m instantaneous field of view (IFOV).

A four-element refractive telescope focuses an f/1.64 beam of thermal radiation onto a cryogenically cooled focal plane, which holds three modules with quantum-well-infrared-photodetector (QWIP) arrays arranged in an alternating pattern along the focal plane centerline. The QWIPs detect long wavelengths of light emitted by the Earth whose intensity depends on surface temperature. The QWIPs TIRS uses are sensitive to two thermal infrared wavelength bands, helping it separate the temperature of the Earth's surface from that of the atmosphere. Their design operates on the complex principles of quantum mechanics. Gallium arsenide semiconductor chips trap electrons in an energy state 'well' until the electrons are elevated to a higher state by thermal infrared light of a certain wavelength. The elevated electrons create an electrical signal that can be read out and recorded to create a digital image. Each QWIP array is 640 detectors long cross-track allowing for overlap between the arrays to produce an effective linear array of 1850 pixels, spanning the 185 km ground swath with a 100 m spatial resolution. The spectral bands have wavelengths centred on 10.8 micrometres (band 1) and 12 micrometres (band 2). Flown on Landsat-8. http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=5474",3,false,2017-08-10 12:37:04.0

It measures the spectral signature of chlorophyll, and also detects soil moisture and vegetation for the characterization and correction of atmospheric effects on reflectance. This information is used for measurements of vegetation canopies, either for scientific studies involving both regional and global scale experiments (for example development of models of biosphere dynamics interacting with climate models), or for monitoring crops, pastures and forests. The instrument collects radiation reflected by the earth's surface to convert it into usable electrical signals. Silicon linear arrays are used for spectral band B0 (Blue), B2 (Red) and B3 (Near-Infrared), while InGaAs linear array is used for the Short Wave Infrared spectral band. Each array features 1728 individual CCD detectors. The output voltage signals are fed to a multiplexer (beforehand SWIR voltages are adjusted for dark current values), then to a single analogue to digital converter (ADC). All sensors are processed by a single high precision 11 bit ADC, thus completely by-passing the problem of electronic interband calibration. VEGETATION operates in the following spectrums: blue (0.43-0.47 micrometres), red (0.61-0.68 micrometres), near-infrared (0.78-0.89 micrometres) and shortwave-infrared (1.58-1.75 micrometres).

It was a low-power, low-mass test-bed for future space-borne altimeters. SSALT consists of two packages: the processing and control unit (PCU), and the radio frequency unit (RFU). SSALT sends a pulse generated by a surface acoustic wave generator with a 300 MHz bandwidth and 900 MHz frequency to the sea surface. The pulses are amplified before transmission, and frequency converted to 13.65 GHz after generation. The received pulses are also amplified and an FFT (fast fourier transform) analyser computes the power spectrum of the signal. The signal is sent through a microprocessor which performs the waveform computations to produce the output data.  SSALT operates at a single frequency of 13.65 GHz (Ku band), with a measurement accuracy within 10 cm (typically 2.5 cm).

The instrument operates as an active remote sensing device, emitting microwave pulses in the C-band frequency range (2 GHz - 4 GHz) and recording the response reflected by the Earth's surface targeted. The time it takes for each emitted pulse to return to the instrument holds information on the distance of the target object, whilst the amount of the signal returned is used to extract information on surface properties. ASAR operates in five mutually exclusive modes, which output images of different sizes and spatial resolution. The instrument is able to create orthogonal polarised waves, the return signal of which can be used to extract information on the type of surface targeted. The user can select an operating mode out of five mutually exclusive options: the Image mode (IM), generating products at a spatial resolution of 30 m over one of seven selectable swath widths determined by incidence angles between 15 degrees to 45 degrees, at horizontal transmit and receive polarisation (HH) or vertical transmit and receive polarisation (VV); the Alternating Polarisation mode (AP), generating products at a spatial resolution of 30 m over one of seven selectable swath widths determined by incidence angles between 15 degrees to 45 degrees, at different dual polarisation combinations (HH/VV or HH/HV or VV/VH); the Wide Swath mode (WS), which uses the ScanSAR technique, thus providing images at 150 m resolution over five combined sub-swaths covering a total of 405 km, in HH or VV polarisation; the Global Monitoring mode (GM), outputting 1 km resolution images over a 405 km swath, in HH or VV polarisation; and the Wave mode (WV), which generates backscatter vignettes of 5 km by 5 km size, spaced 100 km along track in HH or VV polarisation.

It has three operation modes: a) measurement of conductivity without regard to temperature; b) measurement of specific conductance (also known as temperature-compensated conductivity), with adjustable reference temperature set to 25 degC by default; c) salinity calculation based upon conductivity and temperature readings. The probe utilises a cell with four nickel electrodes for the measurement of solution conductance; two of the electrodes are current-driven, and two are used to measure the voltage drop. The measured voltage drop is then converted into a conductance value in milliSiemens.

http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL0405/,SDN:L22::TOOL0405,National Marine Facilities Microelectrode Oxygen Sensor,"A non-membrane dissolved oxygen sensor for marine applications. The sensor uses a platinum microelectrode and a counter electrode (thus far composed of copper). A measurement potential is applied to the microelectrode relative to a counter electrode, reducing the dissolved oxygen in the water and generating a current through the microelectrode proportional to the number of oxygen molecules at that electrode. The sensor was first used in 2000 and development is ongoing. Early versions of the instrument applied the measurement potential for up to 30 seconds, with sampling starting approximately one second after the potential was applied. The sensor response to oxygen remained almost constant for a given concentration and data could be sampled at frequencies exceeding 1 Hz. To reduce noise generated by sensitivity to flow fluctuations a mesoporous layer was used to increase the surface area of the microelectrode, but this proved unstable and was replaced by a stop-flow system which pumped water in to a very small chamber, with measurements being taken while the water was still. This significantly improved results but the sensor was still affected by small convection currents. The current version of the sensor only applies the measurement potential for a few 10s of milliseconds and data are collected at approximately 1 Hz in an attempt to minimise the effects of convection currents. The latest development is a very small sensor head containing an array of microelectrodes (currently an array of five) that work together. The counter electrode consists of silver or silver chloride.

Functioning in one of two operational modes (ocean or ice), the Radar Altimeter provides information on significant wave height, surface wind speed, sea surface elevation which relates to ocean currents, the surface geoid and tides, plus various parameters over sea ice and ice sheets. RA operates by timing the two-way delay for a short duration radio frequency pulse, transmitted vertically downwards. The required level of accuracy in range measurement calls for a pulse compression (chirp) technique. In ocean mode a chirped pulse of 20 microsecond duration is generated with a band width of 330 MHz. For tracking in ice mode an increased dynamic range is used, obtained by reducing the chirp bandwidth by a factor of four to 82.5 MHz, though resulting in a coarser resolution.

The laser transmits two pulses at 40 Hz of visible green light (1064 nm) and infrared light (532 nm) towards the Earth's surface, the return signals of which are detected by the telescope and recorded along the laser pointing vector. The time interval taken by the laser pulse to make a round trip from the instrument to the Earth's surface and back, can be converted into distance; this series of altimeter measurements, together with positional measurements and calibrations carried out by the various instrument components, can be assembled to determine surface topography as well as temporal changes in surface topography. The instruments samples along-track (nadir only view) at intervals of 170m within an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 66m. The vertical resolution is 10cm at the surface, and 200m at cloud top.

RA-2 also measures the power and the shape of the reflected radar pulses.  It's design is based on the heritage of ERS-1 Radar Altimeter (RA). RA-2  transmits frequency modulated pulses (chirp) pulses. This frequency modulation is a coding of the signal which spreads the energy of a short pulse over a longer time interval, thus allowing reduced peak power in the pulse. The transmit pulses, which are generated in the chirp generator (by means of SAW  RAC) are amplified by either Ku-band or S-Band amplifiers, depending on the selected transmit frequency. The Ku-band HPA uses a traveling wave tube whilst the S-band transmitter applies the solid state technology. The Ku-band front end electronics (KFEE) or the S-band front end electronics (SFEE) feed the signals to be transmitted to the antenna which is designed as a dual-frequency parabolic antenna.  RA-2  operates at 13.575 GHz (Ku-band) and 3.2 GHz (S-Band) and at high precision at less than a nanosecond. It measures the power level and time delay of 128 samples of echoes from ocean, ice, and land surfaces. It is optimised to maintain the leading edge of this echo in the range window.

AS the satellites moves along track, the antenna records successive target scenes thus forming the 'synthetic antenna aperture'. Signal processing of the recorded scenes allows the creation of higher resolution images. Data collection is independent of light and heat, and is therefore possible day and night, under any weather condition. TerraSAR-X operates in three alternate operating modes: SpotLight, giving 1 m resolution for a surface area of 5 km by 10 km; StripMap, giving 3 m resolution for a surface area of 30 km by 50 km; and ScanSAR giving 16 m resolution for a surface area of 100 km by 150 km.

The SAR radar operates by obtaining strips of imagery in two modes: the imaging mode, and the wave mode. In imaging mode, SAR provides two-dimensional images between (6 - 30)m along-track at a spatial resolution of 26m. In wave mode, imagettes of 5 km by 5 km in size are captured at regular intervals of 200 km along track; the imagettes are then processed within the swath to obtain the wave spectra, as changes in radar reflectivity on the sea surface are proxies for length and direction of surface waves. SCAT is composed by three sideways-looking antennae which generate radar beams at 45, 90 and 135 degrees azimuth across a swath 500 km wide situated 200 km to the right of the sub-satellite track. The radar backscatter is then measured for overlapping cells of 50 km resolution, using a grid spacing of 25 km. This technique permits three different viewing directions almost simultaneously, facilitating the determination of surface wind vectors. SAR and SCAT can be operated together, unless SAR is in imaging mode. The wave direction detected range is (0 - 180) degrees, at an accuracy of +/- 20 degrees; the detected wavelength range is (100 - 1000)m, with an accuracy of +/- 25%.
